## Components Used :
> For clearer understanding and cleaner code I have broken down the app to  small components and put the in the components folder.
- ActionBar - This components contains various actions that can be performed with the doc - Comment , Share in a video , Share with others etc
- AppsBar - This component consist of links to various google apps .
- ToolBar - This component helps user apply various formatting to their text editor . (For now only the font-size is made functional using react state management)
- Header - This is the top most part of the page it contains the Action Bar , Menubar , Title etc .
- MenuBar - This contains list of menus with actions that can be performed
- Title - This displays the name of the document .
- Editor - This is the component where user enters,edits,views the text .

## Tech Used :
 The project is written using React Framework .
 The project used MUI icons for various icons used in the project .

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
